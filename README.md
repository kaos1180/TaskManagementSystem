# TaskManagementSystem
 
1. Introduction
The Task Management System is a web-based application designed to help users organize and optimize their tasks efficiently. The system provides a user-friendly interface for adding, managing, and scheduling tasks. This project aims to enhance task management capabilities and improve the overall user experience.

2. Objectives
The primary objectives of the Task Management System project include:

Task Addition and Deletion:

Allow users to add tasks with specific details and delete tasks as needed.
Due Date and Time Allocation:

Enable users to allocate due dates and times for tasks, providing a scheduling feature.
User Interface Design:

Create a clean and intuitive user interface for seamless interaction.
Pomodoro Technique Integration:

Integrate the Pomodoro Technique timer, allowing users to set focused work sessions (Pomodoros) followed by short breaks to improve concentration and productivity.


3. Tools/Environment Used
The development of the Task Management System involves the use of the following technologies:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Database: Not implemented (for simplicity, using in-memory storage)
Version Control: Git
Deployment: Local development environment (for now)
4. Analysis Document
The analysis phase includes defining software requirements and creating simplified diagrams:

Software Requirements Specification (SRS): Outlines the essential requirements for the Task Management System.

Diagrams: Include simplified diagrams illustrating the task management process.

5. Design Document
The design phase focuses on modularization, data integrity, procedural design, and user interface design:

Modularization Details: Overview of the modular structure of the Task Management System.

Data Integrity & Constraints: Summary of measures for data integrity.

Procedural Design and User Interface Design: Brief description of procedural design for task operations and key elements of user interface design.

6. Program Code
The program code is organized using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and Node.js with Express.js for the backend. The code allows users to add tasks, allocate due dates and times, and delete tasks. The current implementation uses in-memory storage for simplicity.

7. Testing
Testing includes unit testing for critical components. Future iterations will include more comprehensive testing for different aspects of the system.

8. Input and Output Screens
Screenshots of the Task Management System in action, illustrating the input forms and task list display.

9. Implementation of Security
Did not seem it fit to include any sort of "security" because I wanted this project to be used locally from the start. User authentication is not implementd from the same reason.

10. Limitations of the Project
The system currently relies on in-memory storage for simplicity.
The system currently lacks user authentication and authorization.
Data is stored in-memory, limiting scalability.
Comprehensive testing, including penetration testing and security assessments, has not been conducted.
Only tested on mainstream browsers like Chrome, Edge and Firefox. Other browsers were not given any consideration.

11. Future Application of the Project
Future enhancements include:

User authentication and authorization.
Integration with a database for persistent storage.
Advanced task management features like task prioritization and collaboration.
